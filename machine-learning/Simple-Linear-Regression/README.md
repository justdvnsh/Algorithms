# Simple-linear-regression

We have talked a lot about the simple linear algorithm . You can read the full blog post [here](https://justdvnsh.github.io/2018/06/06/simple-linear-regression/). This blog would be all about coding the same algorithm from scratch , so that, we could gather a deeper level understanding of how the algorithm works. So, without any further ado, let's get coding .
